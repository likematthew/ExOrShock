This is a manual on how to create a cup which shocks you if you don´t empty it in a certain amount of time.
### Disclaimer
***This build contains high voltage parts which can hurt you and persons using the cup.***
***We are not responsible for any harms that are made by trying to recreating the cup with this manual or using it.***
## How the cup works
Before you start, you have to fill up the cup to the top with water. After that, you start the cup with switching on an external battery pack which is located on the bottom. After the cup was switched on, all three LEDs (Blue, Green, Red) are going to light up. Then the calibration mode starts, which calibrates the lowest values of the moisture level sensors that are located directly in the cup. During the calibration the three LEDs start lighting from top to bottom fifteen times. After the calibration the blue LED is going to blink slowly. This means the cup waits for a value from the Bluetooth module, which you need to connect to and send the seconds how long it should take to empty the cup. After the seconds were received, the blue LED stays lighted. Now the cup is ready for someone to start drinking. If you now tilt the cup to start drinking, the upper moisture level sensor will notice it and the blue LED will start blinking again. The LED will blink faster and faster while the time is running out. If you finished the cup before the time runs out, the green LED will shine. If you don´t finish the cup before the time runs out, the red LED will shine and you will get shocked. Then the circle starts again and the blue LED will start blinking till you send the time via Bluetooth again.
## What you need for the build
First of all, in the best case you have a little bit of programming knowledge and you also know what an Arduino is and how to use it.
